Q1. When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A: When some big changes are made, other contributors can review the lastest version easily.

Q2. Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: So that I can be aware of any changes recently made. Besides, I can pull the remote to the branches other than local master.
   Also, if somehow, I get my local master messy, I don't want any auto-update from remote to make it more messy!
